# Projet Programmation Graphique IMIS

A simple Android game app, made using **OpenGL ES 3.0**.

# Conception and instructions
- The game's design is abstract and simple. It only uses basic shapes and colours.
- It is a turn-based two-player game, where the starting player is **red** and the 2nd player is coloured **lavender**.
- Each player takes turn by betting on the **orange card** on the right, either by guessing their card is ***less than, greater than or equal to*** it.
- If the player's guess is correct, they could either continue betting or pass their turn by clicking on the **X** button that appears.
- The interface changes colour based on what player is currently betting.
- The game ends when either player's deck empties first, when that happens, the game fills with the winner's colour and prompts a new game by pressing the **black replay button**. 
- It is possible to reset the game by pressing the purple square on the bottom-right of the screen.
- A square is displayed on top the card slots to indicate how close a player is to winning, the fuller the square is, the closer they are.


# The video

- the video had been realized with the debug mode enabled, this mode tells the current player what to bet everytime. It is highlighted by the green color of the interface.
